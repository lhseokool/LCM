## Download COCO 2017 Val Images

Download the COCO 2017 validation images (5,000 images, approximately 1GB in size):

```bash
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip
unzip val2017.zip
```

After downloading and extracting the files, you should have the following structure:
```bash
val2017/                          # Directory containing the validation images
annotations/captions_val2017.json # Caption annotations for validation images
```
